**1. `__init__` Method**

This method is the constructor for the `Actor` class. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up the neural network architecture. Let's break it down:

- `self.hidden_0` and `self.hidden_1` are the sizes (number of nodes) of the two hidden layers in the neural network.
- `self.actions_dim` is the dimension of the action space, which means the number of values that need to be outputted by the neural network to represent an action.
- `self.net_name` is simply the name of the network instance.
- `self.upper_bound` is the maximum value that an action can take.
- `self.epsilon` is a small constant value used for numerical stability in certain calculations.
- `self.log_std_min` and `self.log_std_max` are the minimum and maximum values allowed for the log-standard deviation outputted by the neural network.
- `self.dense_0` and `self.dense_1` are the first two hidden layers of the neural network, with ReLU activation functions.
- `self.mean` is the output layer that produces the mean of the action distribution.
- `self.log_std` is the output layer that produces the log-standard deviation of the action distribution.

**2. `call` Method**

This method defines the forward pass of the neural network. It takes the state as input and returns the mean and log-standard deviation of the action distribution as output. Here's what's happening:

- `policy = self.dense_0(state)` passes the input state through the first hidden layer.
- `policy = self.dense_1(policy)` passes the output of the first hidden layer through the second hidden layer.
- `mean = self.mean(policy)` passes the output of the second hidden layer through the `mean` output layer, producing the mean of the action distribution.
- `log_std = self.log_std(policy)` passes the output of the second hidden layer through the `log_std` output layer, producing the log-standard deviation of the action distribution.
- `log_std = tf.clip_by_value(log_std, self.log_std_min, self.log_std_max)` ensures that the log-standard deviation values are within the specified minimum and maximum range.

**3. `get_action_log_probs` Method**

This method is used to sample actions from the policy distribution and compute their log probabilities. Here's what's happening:

- `mean, log_std = self.call(state)` calls the `call` method to get the mean and log-standard deviation of the action distribution for the given state.
- `std = tf.exp(log_std)` computes the standard deviation by taking the exponential of the log-standard deviation.
- `normal_distr = tfp.distributions.Normal(mean, std)` creates a normal (Gaussian) distribution using the mean and standard deviation obtained from the neural network.
- `z = tf.random.normal(shape=mean.shape, mean=0., stddev=1.)` generates a random noise vector from a standard normal distribution with the same shape as the mean.
- If `reparameterization_trick` is True, `actions = mean + std * z` computes the actions by adding the noise vector scaled by the standard deviation to the mean (reparameterization trick). Otherwise, `actions = normal_distr.sample()` directly samples actions from the normal distribution.
- `action = tf.math.tanh(actions) * self.upper_bound` applies the hyperbolic tangent function to the actions, scaling them to the range `[-upper_bound, upper_bound]`.
- `log_probs = normal_distr.log_prob(actions) - tf.math.log(1 - tf.math.pow(action, 2) + self.epsilon)` computes the log probabilities of the sampled actions, with a correction term that accounts for the squashing of the actions by the `tanh` function.
- `log_probs = tf.math.reduce_sum(log_probs, axis=1, keepdims=True)` sums the log probabilities over the action dimensions, resulting in a single log probability value for each sample.

The `get_action_log_probs` method returns the sampled actions and their corresponding log probabilities.

In summary, the `Actor` class defines a neural network that takes the state as input and outputs the parameters (mean and standard deviation) of a normal distribution over the action space. The `get_action_log_probs` method is used to sample actions from this distribution and compute their log probabilities, which are needed for training the actor network using reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG.
